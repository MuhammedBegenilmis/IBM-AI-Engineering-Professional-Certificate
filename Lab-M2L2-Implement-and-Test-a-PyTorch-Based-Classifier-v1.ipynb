    "Congratulation! You've successfully built, trained, and evaluated a deep learning model for image classification using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you coded for:\n",
    "- **Data loading pipeline:** Implementing ImageDataGenerator for efficient on-the-fly image loading, resizing, normalization, and vital data augmentation.\n",
    "- **CNN architecture:** Building a multi-layered CNN incorporating Conv2D layers.\n",
    "- **Model training setup:** Configuring the model’s learning process using the Adam optimizer, BCEWithLogitsLoss, and tracking accuracy and loss metrics.\n",
    "- **Training process:** Executing the training loop by feeding data in batches and monitoring performance over epochs.\n",
    "- **Performance visualization:** Plotting accuracy and loss curves to analyze learning progress and detect overfitting.\n",
    "- **Model evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy_score.\n"
